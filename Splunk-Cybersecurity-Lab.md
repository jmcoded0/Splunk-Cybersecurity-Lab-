# üõ°Ô∏è **My Splunk Cybersecurity Lab: A Deep Dive into Log Analysis & Threat Detection**

Hey there! Welcome to my detailed documentation for setting up a virtual cybersecurity lab. This isn't just a dry guide; it's a step-by-step journey through building a powerful environment with **Splunk Enterprise** to get hands-on with log collection, threat detection, and incident analysis. Think of it as a peek into how I'm using Splunk as a SIEM solution in a truly practical way.

---

## üîç **Project Overview: Why I Built This Lab**

So, what's this whole project about? It's my personal quest to really get to grips with **real-world log collection, threat detection, and incident analysis** using **Splunk Enterprise**. I wanted a safe, controlled space where I could simulate security operations, mess around, break things (and fix them!), and truly understand how a SIEM works. This lab is all about getting those practical skills locked in!

---

## üß© **The Awesome Gear I'm Using (Key Components)**

To bring this cybersecurity playground to life, I'm relying on a few core pieces of tech:

* **Splunk Enterprise:** This is the heart of the operation, my central SIEM platform. It's where all the magic happens ‚Äì collecting, indexing, searching, analyzing, and visualizing tons of log data.

* **Ubuntu Server (My Splunk Brain):** This virtual machine is dedicated to hosting my Splunk Enterprise instance. It's the robust backend that keeps everything humming along.

* **Kali Linux (My Attack Machine):** This is where the "threat" part of "threat detection" comes in! I'm using Kali to generate all sorts of juicy security events and logs ‚Äì everything from network scans to brute-force attempts. It also hosts the Splunk Universal Forwarder, sending those logs over to Splunk.

* **VirtualBox:** My virtualization superhero. This is how I'm running both my Ubuntu server and Kali Linux, keeping my lab neatly contained and isolated from my main system.

* **SSH (My Remote Control):** Super handy for securely jumping into my Ubuntu and Kali VMs from my host machine. It makes running commands and moving files around a breeze.

## üß± **Lab Setup & Walkthrough: Let's Get Our Hands Dirty!**

Alright, this is the really exciting part ‚Äì the actual setup! I'm going to walk you through each phase, and I've made sure to point out exactly where your awesome screenshots will fit in to show off your progress.

### 1. üîß **Getting My Splunk Server Ready & SSHing In (Ubuntu VM)**

This first phase is all about prepping that Ubuntu virtual machine, making sure it's snug and ready for Splunk, and that I can securely SSH into it whenever I need.

#### 1.1. **Creating the Ubuntu Virtual Machine**

* **My Action:** The very first step was to fire up VirtualBox and create a brand-new virtual machine specifically for Ubuntu. I made sure to give it enough RAM, CPU, and storage ‚Äì gotta make Splunk happy, right?

* **Screenshot:** This is where you'll show off the **VirtualBox "Create Virtual Machine" wizard**. Make sure it highlights that you've selected Linux (Ubuntu 64-bit) and the resources you've allocated (like memory or CPU cores).
    <img width="960" alt="VirtualBox Create Virtual Machine Wizard" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 1.2. **Installing Ubuntu OS**

* **My Action:** After setting up the VM, I installed Ubuntu Server. I just followed the prompts, created my user account, and got the basic network stuff squared away.

* **Screenshot:** Capture that moment! This screenshot should show the **Ubuntu Server installation progress screen**, or even better, the **final terminal login prompt** once the OS is successfully installed.
    <img width="960" alt="Ubuntu Server Installation Progress" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 1.3. **Setting Up My Network**

* **My Action:** Networking can sometimes be a bit tricky, but it's crucial! I configured the network adapter for my Ubuntu VM. I usually go with a **Host-Only Adapter** or **Internal Network** to keep my lab isolated, and then add a **NAT Adapter** if I need internet access for updates.

* **Screenshot:** This is your chance to show off your VirtualBox skills! Display the **VirtualBox VM settings for the Ubuntu VM**, specifically the "Network" section, illustrating how your adapters are set up (e.g., Adapter 1 as NAT, Adapter 2 as Host-Only Network).
    <img width="960" alt="VirtualBox VM Network Settings" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

* **Screenshot:** After configuring in VirtualBox, I jumped into the Ubuntu terminal to confirm everything. Show the **output of the `ip a` command** executed in the Ubuntu VM's terminal, clearly displaying the IP addresses for your network interfaces.
    <img width="960" alt="Ubuntu ip a command output" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 1.4. **Getting SSH Ready (Server Installation and Configuration)**

* **My Action:** SSH is a lifesaver for remote access. I installed `openssh-server` on my Ubuntu VM and then double-checked that it was running smoothly. I also made sure my firewall (UFW) was cool with SSH traffic.
    * **Command:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` (Always a good idea to update!)
    * **Command:** `sudo apt install openssh-server -y`
    * **Command:** `sudo systemctl status ssh` (Checking that service!)
    * **Command:** `sudo ufw allow ssh` (Opening that port!)

* **Screenshot:** Time to show off your terminal! This screenshot should capture the **terminal output** on your Ubuntu VM, showing the successful `openssh-server` installation, the `ssh` service status, and your `ufw` rule allowing SSH.
    <img width="960" alt="SSH Service Status and UFW Rules" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 1.5. **My First Remote SSH Connection**

* **My Action:** The moment of truth! From my host machine (or even my Kali VM later), I tested SSH connectivity to my Ubuntu VM. Success feels good!

* **Screenshot:** You'll want to show off your successful connection here. This screenshot should display a **successful SSH connection** from your host machine (or Kali) to the Ubuntu server, showing the terminal right after you've logged in with your username and password.
    <img width="960" alt="Successful SSH Login to Ubuntu" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

### 2. üì¶ **Installing Splunk Enterprise (Ubuntu VM) ‚Äì The Big One!**

This is the core phase: getting Splunk Enterprise up and running on my freshly prepared Ubuntu server.

#### 2.1. **Downloading Splunk Enterprise**

* **My Action:** I used `wget` to grab the Splunk Enterprise Debian package (`.deb`) directly onto my Ubuntu VM. This saves a lot of hassle.
    * **Command:** `wget -O splunk-enterprise.deb 'https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.x.x/linux/splunk-9.x.x-amd64.deb'` (Just remember to swap out `9.x.x` for the actual version you're using!)

* **Screenshot:** This is a two-in-one! Capture the **terminal output** during the `wget` command execution, showing the **download progress** of the Splunk package. Then, take another screenshot of the **terminal prompt *after* the download is complete**, confirming the file is sitting there, ready for action.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Download Progress and Completion" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 2.2. **Installing Splunk Enterprise**

* **My Action:** With the `.deb` file in hand, installing Splunk was straightforward using `dpkg`.
    * **Command:** `sudo dpkg -i splunk-enterprise.deb`

* **Screenshot:** Show that installation in action! This screenshot should capture the **terminal output** as the `dpkg` command runs, displaying all those satisfying messages indicating successful package unpacking and setup.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk dpkg Installation Process" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 2.3. **Starting Splunk and Accepting the License**

* **My Action:** First boot! I started the Splunk service and, of course, had to agree to their license terms.
    * **Command:** `/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license`

* **Screenshot:** Get this moment! This screenshot should capture the **terminal output** showing Splunk spinning up, including the prompt where you agree to the license.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Service Start and License Prompt" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 2.4. **Setting Up My Splunk Admin & Auto-Start**

* **My Action:** Security first! I set a strong password for my Splunk admin user. Then, I made sure Splunk would automatically kick off every time the server boots up ‚Äì super convenient.
    * **Command:** `/opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start`

* **Screenshot:** Show those commands and their output! This screenshot should display the **terminal commands and their output** where you set the Splunk admin password and confirm that Splunk is now configured to start on boot.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Admin Password and Boot-Start Configuration" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 2.5. **Accessing the Splunk Web Interface (Woohoo!)**

* **My Action:** The payoff! I opened my web browser (on my host machine or Kali) and navigated to the Splunk web interface using my Ubuntu VM's IP address (usually `https://your_ubuntu_vm_ip:8000`). Then, I logged in with my shiny new admin credentials.

* **Screenshot:** Capture the moment of truth! This screenshot should display the **Splunk Web Login page** as it appears in your browser.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Web Login Page" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

* **Screenshot:** And the ultimate victory! Show the **Splunk Home Dashboard** or the initial landing page right after you've successfully logged in. This confirms Splunk is fully operational.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Home Dashboard After Login" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

### 3. üì§ **Setting Up My Log Forwarder (Kali Linux VM)**

Now that Splunk's ready, it's time to get some logs flowing! This phase involves getting Kali Linux set up and deploying the Splunk Universal Forwarder to send logs over to my Splunk Enterprise instance.

#### 3.1. **Creating My Kali VM & OS Installation**

* **My Action:** Just like Ubuntu, I spun up a new VM for Kali Linux and got the operating system installed. Ready to generate some logs!

* **Screenshot:** Show off your Kali desktop! This screenshot should display the **Kali Linux desktop** after a successful installation, or even just the **Kali login screen**.
    <img width="960" alt="Kali Linux Desktop or Login Screen" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 3.2. **Network Configuration for Kali**

* **My Action:** Again, network setup is key. I made sure Kali's network adapters were on the *same isolated network* as my Ubuntu VM. This lets them talk to each other without exposing them to the wider internet (unless I specifically want that for updates).

* **Screenshot:** Show your VirtualBox settings for Kali here. This screenshot should display the **VirtualBox VM settings for the Kali VM**, specifically the "Network" section, showing how its adapters are configured.
    <img width="960" alt="VirtualBox Kali Network Settings" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

* **Screenshot:** Confirm it in the terminal! This screenshot should show the **output of the `ip a` command** executed in the Kali terminal, clearly displaying its assigned IP addresses.
    <img width="960" alt="Kali ip a command output" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 3.3. **Downloading and Installing the Splunk Universal Forwarder**

* **My Action:** Time to get the forwarder onto Kali! I downloaded the Splunk Universal Forwarder package (again, using `wget`) and then installed it.
    * **Command:** `wget -O splunkforwarder.deb 'https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.x.x/linux/splunkforwarder-9.x.x-amd64.deb'`
    * **Command:** `sudo dpkg -i splunkforwarder.deb`

* **Screenshot:** Show the download and install commands running in Kali's terminal. This screenshot should capture the **terminal output** showing the `wget` command downloading the forwarder package and the subsequent `dpkg` command installing it.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Universal Forwarder Download and Installation" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 3.4. **Configuring the Universal Forwarder to Send Logs**

* **My Action:** This is where I tell the forwarder *where* to send logs (my Splunk Enterprise instance) and *which* logs to send. It involves editing two crucial configuration files: `outputs.conf` and `inputs.conf`.

    * **Editing `outputs.conf` (`/opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/outputs.conf`):** This file tells the forwarder where its data should go. I set the `server` to my Ubuntu VM's IP address and the standard Splunk forwarder port `9997`.
        ```ini
        [tcpout]
        defaultGroup = default_group

        [tcpout:default_group]
        server = <Ubuntu_Splunk_IP>:9997  # Don't forget to replace this with your Ubuntu VM's actual IP!
        ```

    * **Editing `inputs.conf` (`/opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf`):** This file tells the forwarder *what* logs to monitor and send. I set it up to grab the system logs (`syslog`) and authentication logs (`auth.log`).
        ```ini
        [monitor:///var/log/syslog]
        sourcetype = syslog

        [monitor:///var/log/auth.log]
        sourcetype = linux_auth
        ```

* **Screenshot:** This is an important one! Show the content of both the **`outputs.conf` and `inputs.conf` files** open in a text editor (like `nano` or `vi`) within the Kali terminal, clearly displaying the stanzas you've configured.
    <img width="960" alt="Universal Forwarder outputs.conf and inputs.conf Configuration" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 3.5. **Starting and Enabling the Universal Forwarder**

* **My Action:** After configuration, I started the Splunk Universal Forwarder service on Kali and made sure it would automatically start on boot.
    * **Command:** `/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk start --accept-license`
    * **Command:** `/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk enable boot-start`

* **Screenshot:** Capture the terminal confirming the forwarder is alive and set to auto-start. This screenshot should show the **terminal output** on Kali showing the forwarder service starting up and the confirmation that it has been enabled to start on boot.
    <img width="960" alt="Universal Forwarder Start and Enable Boot-Start" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 3.6. **Configuring Data Input on Splunk Enterprise (The Receiving End!)**

* **My Action:** My forwarder is sending logs, but Splunk needs to know to *receive* them! On the Splunk Enterprise web interface, I navigated to **Settings > Data Inputs > Forwarded inputs** and added a new TCP input on port `9997` (the same port the forwarder is sending to!).

* **Screenshot:** Show how you set this up in Splunk's GUI. This screenshot should display the **Splunk Web UI** showing the steps or a summary of the configuration for creating a new "Forwarded inputs" on port `9997` on the Splunk Enterprise server.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Web UI - Forwarded Input Configuration" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

* **Screenshot:** The ultimate validation! Show a view within Splunk (maybe the **"Receive data"** section or a quick search in `index=_internal` for forwarder health) confirming that data is actively being received from your Kali forwarder. It's working!
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Web UI - Data Receive Confirmation" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

### 4. üìà **Data Ingestion & Event Simulation: Making Some Noise!**

Now that the pipes are connected, it's time to actually generate some events on Kali Linux and verify that they're showing up in Splunk Enterprise. This is where the fun starts!

#### 4.1. **Generating Sample Logs on Kali**

* **My Action:** To get some data flowing, I performed various actions on Kali Linux that would naturally generate common system logs. Think of it as creating a little digital ruckus!
    * **Command (Simulating failed SSH login attempts):** `ssh fakeuser@localhost` (I ran this a few times to generate some "failed password" entries!)
    * **Command (Generating sudo usage logs):** `sudo whoami` (Simple, but effective for log generation)
    * **Command (Running a small Nmap scan):** `nmap -sS -p 1-100 127.0.0.1` (This generates network-related logs, if your forwarder is set up to capture them!)

* **Screenshot:** Show those commands in action! This screenshot should capture your **Kali terminal** showing the execution of several commands designed to generate security-relevant logs.
    <img width="960" alt="Kali Linux Log Generation Commands" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 4.2. **Verifying Data Ingestion in Splunk (The Payoff!)**

* **My Action:** After generating logs on Kali, I immediately jumped back to the Splunk Enterprise web interface. I went to the **Search & Reporting** app and searched for `index=main` or `source="/var/log/syslog"` to confirm that logs from my Kali machine were indeed pouring in. It's such a satisfying feeling to see them!

* **Screenshot:** This is the proof! Display the **Splunk Search & Reporting interface** with your search query (e.g., `index=main host=<kali_hostname>`) and the resulting raw events or a filtered list of events from your Kali machine. Highlight those Kali logs!
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Search and Reporting - Raw Events from Kali" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

### 5. üïµÔ∏è **Threat Detection & Analysis with SPL: Becoming a Cyber Sleuth!**

This is the really cool part ‚Äì using Splunk's powerful Search Processing Language (SPL) to actually dig through those logs and uncover potential security threats or anomalies. It's like being a detective!

#### 5.1. **Basic Log Search and Filtering**

* **My Action:** I started with the fundamentals: practicing basic SPL queries to filter logs by `sourcetype`, `host`, or specific keywords. Gotta learn to walk before you can run, right?
    * **Example SPL:** `index=main sourcetype=syslog host=<kali_hostname>` (Just grabbing all syslog events from Kali)
    * **Example SPL:** `index=main "failed password"` (Quickly finding all failed login attempts)

* **Screenshot:** Show your basic search! This screenshot should display the **Splunk Search interface** with a simple SPL query and the corresponding search results, demonstrating your filtering capabilities.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Search - Basic Log Filtering" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 5.2. **Detecting Brute-Force Attempts**

* **My Action:** This is a classic! I used SPL to look for multiple failed login attempts coming from the same source within a short time. This is a common indicator of a brute-force attack.
    * **Example SPL:** `index=main "failed password" | stats count by src_ip | where count > 5` (This query counts failed passwords by source IP and then filters for IPs with more than 5 attempts.)

* **Screenshot:** Show your brute-force detection query and its results! This screenshot should display the **Splunk Search interface** with the SPL query for detecting brute-force attempts and the resulting statistical table or visualization.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Search - Brute-Force Detection" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 5.3. **Identifying Port Scans**

* **My Action:** Another common threat: port scanning. If I had network logs properly captured and forwarded (which is a bit more advanced but totally doable!), I'd use SPL to spot patterns indicative of port scanning. Even with system logs, you can sometimes see remnants.
    * **Example SPL (requires network logs like Zeek or other firewall/IDS logs):** `index=main sourcetype=zeek_conn | stats distinct_count(dest_port) by src_ip | where distinct_count(dest_port) > 10` (This looks for source IPs that have tried to connect to many different destination ports.)

* **Screenshot:** Show an example of how you'd look for a port scan. This screenshot should display the **Splunk Search interface** with an SPL query designed to identify port scanning activity and the associated search results.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Search - Port Scan Identification" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 5.4. **Creating Alerts or Dashboards (Optional but Cool!)**

* **My Action:** If I had more time, I'd totally build out some alerts or dashboards. Alerts would notify me immediately of a potential threat, and dashboards would give me a sweet visual overview of my lab's security posture. This is where Splunk really shines for continuous monitoring!

* **Screenshot:** If you tried this, show it! This screenshot should capture either the **configuration page for a Splunk Alert** based on one of your threat detection queries, or a **simple Splunk Dashboard** displaying relevant security metrics or visualizations you've created.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk Alert Configuration or Basic Dashboard" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

### 6. üìù **My Conclusion & What I Learned (Lessons from the Lab!)**

Wrapping up this project, it's cool to reflect on what I achieved and what hitches I ran into. Every challenge was a learning opportunity!

#### 6.1. **My Project Outcomes**

* **Successfully built a virtual cybersecurity lab:** This was a huge win, with Splunk Enterprise and a Universal Forwarder happily talking to each other.
* **Demonstrated end-to-end log collection:** I got logs flowing from my Kali machine right into my SIEM ‚Äì super satisfying!
* **Applied SPL for basic log analysis and threat detection:** I got my hands dirty with searches and even some basic threat hunting.

* **Screenshot:** Let's end with a visual summary! This concluding screenshot could be an **overview of the Splunk Apps page**, or even a **final custom dashboard** you've made that sums up the data and insights gained from your lab.
    <img width="960" alt="Splunk App Overview or Final Lab Dashboard" src="YOUR_SCREENSHOT_URL_HERE" />

#### 6.2. **Challenges I Ran Into (And How I Overcame Them!)**

No project is without its bumps, and this lab was no exception!
* **Network configuration between VMs:** Getting NAT, Host-Only, and Internal networks to play nice always takes a bit of head-scratching, but it's essential for a secure lab.
* **Firewall rules:** Sometimes you forget a port, and things just won't connect! Double-checking UFW on Ubuntu and Kali was key.
* **Forwarder config (`outputs.conf` and `inputs.conf`):** Tiny typos here can cause big headaches. Meticulous checking was my friend.
* **Understanding and debugging SPL queries:** This is a whole language in itself! There was a lot of trial and error, but that's how you learn.

#### 6.3. **My Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned**

This lab was packed with learning! Here are some of my biggest takeaways:

* **Centralized Logging is a Game Changer:** Seriously, having all your logs in one place (thanks, Splunk!) makes spotting threats so much easier. It's the core of effective security monitoring.
* **Threat Hunting Basics are Crucial:** Getting hands-on with searching for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and weird behavior using SPL is invaluable. It's not just theory anymore!
* **Data Normalization Makes Sense:** Seeing how different `sourcetypes` and fields help structure the data for analysis really clicked during this project.
* **Lab Environments are Gold:** Building and experimenting in a controlled environment like this is absolutely the best way to learn and develop skills without messing with live systems.
